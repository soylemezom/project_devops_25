Project Description: Modernizing Retail Operations with DevOps

ABC Technologies, a prominent online retail store, has recently acquired a large offline retail business with a global presence. This acquisition presents an opportunity for ABC to revamp its operations and leverage the acquired business's extensive network to enhance its market reach. However, the acquired business, following traditional development and deployment practices, is facing significant challenges such as low availability, limited scalability, and poor performance.

To address these challenges and maximize the potential of the acquisition, ABC Technologies has initiated a project to modernize the acquired business's operations using the DevOps model. The project aims to streamline development, testing, packaging, and deployment processes, ultimately reducing time-to-market and ensuring high-quality service for end-users.

The first phase of the project involves creating servlets for adding and displaying product details, along with developing an HTML page for adding products. The team will use Git for source code management. Subsequently, the project will focus on integrating GitHub with Jenkins for continuous build generation and continuous delivery, as well as integrating with Ansible and Kubernetes for deployment. Docker Hub will be utilized for managing images between Ansible and Kubernetes.

Key objectives of the project include:

Developing a CI/CD pipeline to automate software development, testing, packaging, and deployment processes.
Pushing code to GitHub repository.
Creating a Jenkins pipeline for compiling, testing, and packaging code.
Writing Dockerfiles to deploy the WAR file to the Tomcat server.
Integrating Docker with Ansible and writing playbooks for deployment.
Deploying artifacts to the Kubernetes cluster.
Monitoring resources using Grafana.
By implementing these initiatives, ABC Technologies aims to transform the acquired business's operations, enhancing its competitiveness in the retail market and positioning it for sustained growth and success.
